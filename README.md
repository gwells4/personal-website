## Milestone 1 Feedback
Nice job on defining the direction and purpose of your PWP. Based upon your Persona's needs, I see that you might be planning to focus on front-end design and development (responsive) in addition to back end (payments). What you have here should provide you with a good direction to get started with the design phase of your project. Think about how you may want to showcase your work in your layout design. How many projects would you like to feature, and how could they be laid out on the page? A graphic or visual that highlights your core skill set might also be a nice feature to consider. 

There are some technical things I'd like you to fix before beginning Milestone 2&alpha;. See Edits &amp; Suggestions below.

Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier II](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You're clear to begin Milestone 2&alpha;

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Your directory structure needs some adjustment. Create a directory named `public_html`, and move `/css` `/documentation` and `/img` inside. It might also be a good idea to rename your Milestone CSS file to be specific to your Milestone documentation, and not confused with a general CSS file you may use to develop your site. 
- Line 7 in your HTML isn't working. It looks like you're trying to add a favicon. These days, there are only about 9,999,999.99 favicon image files you need to add to your HTML &lt;head&gt; tag for full cross browser/device support. :P Have a look at this: [http://realfavicongenerator.net/](http://realfavicongenerator.net/)

					<li>
						<b>Needs</b><br>
						<ul>
							<li>The website may be in need of an update or a complete overhaul.</li>

							<li>There is a desire to shift from customer payment via PayPal to Stripe.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Frustrations</b><br>
						<ul>
							<li>Their website was written many (that is, five) years ago, and it doesn't incorporate all the latest features available through CSS.</li>
							<li>The code was written by a contract web development company, and it is not commented well. So no one at the company really understands how it works, and they don't want to invest the time understanding it if they can pay someone else to do it.</li>
							<li>They feel like they're losing potential customers everyday.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>

						<b>Scenarios</b><br>
						<ol>
							<li>They want to expand their market to Africa, and so they want to be compatible with facebook's free basics platform.</li>
							<li>Customers don't want to use PayPal, anymore. They would like to use teir credit cards, directly.</li>
							<li>Many of their customers are now accessing them through mobile devices, and they want their sites to be responsive to mobile devices.</li>
						</ol>
